### 📦 Trust Stack

ActiveTrust is designed to layer seamlessly into the EchoMesh and Dust5D architecture:

#### 1. Dust5D – Temporal Graph Inference

Trust flows like time. ActiveTrust anchors interactions in Dust5D's time-aware graph structure.

#### 2. Banano Wallet MFA

Presence is proven by signature.

* Wallet = node identity
* Signed message = consent handshake
* Transaction = trust expression

#### 3. Dynamic Identity Graphs

Roles emerge from interaction frequency, mutual co-signs, and peer-trust lineage.

#### 4. Relational Trust Fabric

Trust is mapped as a **living lattice** — node-to-node interactions become signed graph edges.

### 🛠️ Use Cases

* Co-sign simulation sessions
* Grant file access based on proximity + intent
* Create revocable trust paths with TTL
* Auto-grant permissions based on DAG interactions
* Consent-based UX: from settings to secrets

### 🔁 Trust Model: Co-Sign or Bounce

| Model                | Premise                  | Mechanism                    | Outcome                | Trust Type            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Allow / Deny**     | Authority grants access  | Static policy enforcement    | Binary: Yes or No      | Imposed / Static      |
| **Co-Sign / Bounce** | Alignment enables access | Mutual cryptographic consent | Mutual: Aligned or Not | Emergent / Contextual |

> You don’t pass a gate.
> You **form an agreement** in the moment.
