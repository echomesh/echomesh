# 📡 echoCANP – EchoMesh Contextual Asset Naming Protocol

> “Every reference is a node. Every dot is an edge.”

`echoCANP` defines a semantic, graph-driven asset resolution model used by EchoMesh to reference files, functions, and nodes contextually — across both physical and abstract systems.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Traditional paths reference **location**.
**EchoCANP references context.**

Where file systems are rigid,
EchoCANP is relational.
Where URLs resolve to servers,
EchoCANP resolves to **meaning**.

---

## 🔤 Syntax

```
[protocol]://[domain].[context].[subcontext].[identifier].[extension]
```

* `protocol` → Governs routing and behavior (e.g., `echo`, `dag`)
* `domain` → Root context (e.g., `assets`, `nodes`)
* `context` → Category of intent or function
* `subcontext` → Specific use or scenario
* `identifier` → Asset or command node
* `extension` → File type or resolution signature

## 🧪 Examples

| CANP Reference                                | Meaning                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `dag://assets.solar_system.earth.texture.jpg` | DAG-signed asset reference |
| `echo://nodes.esp32.lora.presence.init.json`  | Presence packet structure  |

---

## 📦 Resolution Logic

```javascript
function resolveEchoCANP(dotPath) {
  const parts = dotPath.split('.');
  const ext = parts.pop();
  const id = parts.pop();
  const path = parts.join('/');
  return `${path}/${id}.${ext}`;
}
```

> Interprets each `.` as a graph edge.
> Final `id.ext` is the terminal node.

---

## 🧬 Versioning Philosophy

EchoCANP is not versioned by tag (`v1`, `v2`) —
It’s versioned by **contextual shift**.

Each new dotpath (e.g., `.augmented`, `.refined`, `.forked`)
represents an emergent, semantically distinct branch.

---

## 🧠 Mesh Integration

EchoCANP is used throughout EchoMesh to:

* Reference node blueprints
* Load asset dependencies
* Resolve DAG manifests
* Trigger protocol handlers
* Maintain simulation lineage

## 🔐 EchoCANP in a Registry

```json
{
  "registry": {
    "echo://assets.solar_system.earth.texture.jpg": {
      "resolved_path": "assets/solar_system/earth/texture.jpg",
      "affinity_scope": "field.rendering",
      "verified": true,
      "version": "initial",
      "source": "CommandPi"
    }
  }
}
```

## ✨ Why It Matters

EchoCANP is the bridge between cognition and code.
It elevates file access to **contextual graph alignment**.
Where others store files — EchoMesh builds meaning.

---

## 📎 Appendix: ActiveTrust Alignment

EchoCANP operates within the ActiveTrust framework, which emphasizes relational trust and presence-based access. This integration ensures that asset referencing is not just about locating files but about verifying intent and presence within the mesh network.

### 🔐 Identity Principles (EchoMesh Canonical Pairs)

ActiveTrust redefines access through relational primitives:

| **Pair**                 | **Meaning**                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intent / Presence**    | Intent is signed. Presence is verified. Together, they form the consent moment. |
| **Input / Output**       | Trust is transactional — signals are both sent and received.                    |
| **Request / Response**   | Every access starts with a question and ends with mutual agreement.             |
| **Inlet / Outlet**       | Nodes open to trust (inlet) or express signals (outlet).                        |
| **Signal / Trace**       | Presence is ephemeral. Trust is logged.                                         |
| **Anchor / Propagate**   | Anchor a moment. Propagate a state.                                             |
| **Proof / Consent**      | Proof validates identity; Consent enables access.                               |
| **Coherence / Autonomy** | Trust is contextual, not controlling. Autonomy remains sovereign.               |

> **ActiveTrust is not a switch. It’s a handshake.**
