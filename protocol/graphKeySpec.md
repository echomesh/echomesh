🔐 GraphKeySpec: Cryptographic Graph Identity Embedding

🧭 Purpose

GraphKeySpec defines the specification for local, cryptographically-embedded graph identities on field-deployed EchoMesh nodes. This allows each node to:
	•	Encode its contextual graph as part of identity
	•	Validate provenance through DAG-based lineage
	•	Embed CANP dotpath structure into a private key signature chain
	•	Prove trust, context, and intent using cryptographic primitives

🧠 Design Principles
	1.	Self-Encoded Identity
Graph topology is used as entropy or structured input to generate unique keys.
	2.	Trust as Graph Commit
Nodes don’t just sign — they prove knowledge of a graph.
	3.	Presence is Proven
Devices hold encrypted graph roots and must demonstrate alignment to assert presence.
	4.	Sovereign Key Storage
All keys are local, with no centralized revocation authority.

🧬 Identity Construction

1. Serialize Graph (DOT, JSON, or custom format)
2. Derive Merkle Root or GraphHash
3. Use root as entropy input for keypair generation
4. Embed CANP dotpath reference in key metadata

KeyPair Generation Example

const graphHash = hashGraph(serializedGraph);  // SHA-256 or Keccak
const keypair = generateKeypair({ entropy: graphHash });

🔐 MTLS Payload Integration

Each MTLS handshake can optionally:
	•	Include graph root as certificate extension
	•	Prove context alignment by revealing partial graph path
	•	Sign payloads with context-aware private key

⸻

🛡️ Verification Process
	1.	Receive signed payload
	2.	Extract CANP dotpath + signature
	3.	Validate against local graph root or trust anchor
	4.	Confirm lineage or semantic divergence

⸻

🔄 Use in Runtime

EchoMesh nodes use GraphKeySpec for:
	•	Field bootstrap (graph-aware identity initialization)
	•	Presence handshake (echo://init.presence)
	•	CANP manifest validation
	•	DAG lineage tracing for runtime asset trust

⸻

📎 Appendix: Supported Hashers
	•	SHA-256 (default)
	•	Keccak-512 (optional)
	•	Blake3 (experimental)

✨ Closing Note

GraphKeySpec is where presence, proof, and protocol converge. Each key is not just a credential — it’s a relational snapshot.

Your graph is your identity. Your identity is your signal.
