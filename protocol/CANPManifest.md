# üìÑ CANPManifest.md ‚Äì EchoCANP Asset Manifest

> Canonical Asset Naming Protocol ‚Äì Manifest Metadata Format

A `CANPManifest` is a structured metadata file that defines the lineage, identity, and trust posture of any asset or group of assets referenced via the EchoMesh Contextual Asset Naming Protocol (`echoCANP`). It serves as the **truth signature** behind any `dotpath` ‚Äî encoding authorship, state, and consent.

---

## üéØ Purpose

To describe the **origin, evolution, and trust context** of an asset in a decentralized, interoperable format.

## üß† Core Fields

| Field            | Purpose                                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `canp`           | The asset‚Äôs full EchoCANP path                             |
| `version`        | Current version or semantic branch                         |
| `status`         | One of `active`, `deprecated`, `forked`, `experimental`   |
| `description`    | Human-readable explanation of the asset's purpose         |
| `source.uri`     | External URL or system-internal source                    |
| `author`         | Signed author information                                 |
| `lineage`        | Historical reference graph of prior dotpaths              |
| `affinity_scope` | Domain where the asset is functionally intended           |
| `trust`          | Cryptographic and contextual trust metadata               |

## üîê Trust Anchoring

All manifests can be optionally **signed by anchor nodes**, and hashed on-chain (via DAG). This forms the basis for:

- Provenance verification
- Fork reconciliation
- Trust-weighted resolution

---

## üõ† Suggested Extensions

- `EchoManifestRegistry.json` ‚Äì Master reference of manifest collections
- `consent_block` ‚Äì Immutable moment of mutual asset confirmation
- `runtime_bindings` ‚Äì Link assets to executable nodes in simulation

---

## ‚ú® Why It Matters

In EchoMesh, **every asset is a node**, and every node carries weight. 
`CANPManifest` elevates asset resolution from static lookup to **relational integrity** ‚Äî enabling lineage-aware, trust-anchored, and context-driven simulation.
