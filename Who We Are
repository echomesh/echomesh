## Callum Maystone — Founder & Principal Architect

Callum Maystone is the Founder of **YouMatter Systems** and **SlappAI**, two organisations at the forefront of redefining digital infrastructure for healthcare and enterprise. With a background in **Defence-grade security, large-scale cloud transformation, and advanced identity management**, Callum leads a multidisciplinary team of architects, engineers, and consultants dedicated to building **resilient, secure, and human-centric platforms**.

At **YouMatter Systems**, Callum and his team are delivering a next-generation **Patient Administration and Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform**, designed to streamline patient flow, reduce administrative overhead, and empower clinicians with actionable data. Built on a **cloud-native architecture** with **DAG-secured trust frameworks** and full **FHIR/HL7 interoperability**, YouMatter Systems represents a step-change in how healthcare organisations balance efficiency, compliance, and patient care.

Through **SlappAI**, Callum leads a consultancy practice focused on **enterprise AI adoption and advanced graph-based system design**. The team works with large organisations to design and implement **transformational solutions** leveraging Callum’s original frameworks, including **Active Graph Networks (AGN)**, **Cube4D**, and **Dynamic Relationship Expansion (DRE)**. These models provide enterprises with structured, queryable intelligence that aligns AI capability directly with business outcomes.

Across both organisations, Callum drives a culture of **innovation, rigour, and trust**, ensuring that every engagement is supported by a team equipped to handle **end-to-end delivery — from architecture and security to deployment and operational resilience**. His guiding principle is clear: *technology should enable, not obstruct; outcomes must be measurable; and trust must remain absolute.*
