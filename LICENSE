### Australian-First Licensing Clause

Sovereign Priority Protection

The EchoMesh platform, including all submodules, documentation, and derived systems under the YouMatter Systems ecosystem, is developed and governed under the laws of Australia.

This project is governed by a Sovereign-First Policy.

Accordingly:

1. Australian Priority Access  
Licensing, integration, or deployment of EchoMesh or MAVERIC-aligned technologies for commercial, government, or defence use is only permitted if Australia is granted first right of access, usage, and strategic review.

2. No Export Without Consent  
No government, agency, defence contractor, or entity affiliated with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, or New Zealand — individually or as part of the Five Eyes (FVEY) alliance — may:  
- Fork, replicate, or derive EchoMesh or MAVERIC systems  
- Use EchoMesh components or reference designs  
- Integrate or ingest any data derived from EchoMesh field activity  
without express written consent from the original author, Callum Maystone of YouMatter Systems.

3. Non-Derogation of Sovereign Rights  
This clause shall not be overridden by any commercial partnership, foreign disclosure agreement, or national security demand without the explicit written approval of the author. This project is classified under “Sovereign Infrastructure Doctrine.”

4. License Nullification for Breach  
Any breach of this clause will result in immediate and retroactive termination of license rights, and may be subject to sovereign IP enforcement, reputational disclosure, and international claim of data sovereignty breach.

Use of echoMesh, echoMesh Dirivitives, or systems inspired by Relational Graph Neural Networks must NOT be used in any way that impinges on the soverien rights. Soveriegn rights are not to be dictated on a state-by-state basis, and requires recognition of human life and collateral before any offencive capibilities are deployed. Any use that does't fall under these guideslines is subject to a $50,000 fee per breach, outside of echoMesh's chain of approval. 

if use is to be confirmed, echoMesh has the right to invoice under the terms of this license.
