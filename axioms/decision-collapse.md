# 🧠 Decision Collapse Paradox

> “Is the goal to make a decision with as little data as possible, as much data as possible, or is no one actually willing to make a fucking decision at all?”

---

## 🔍 Summary

Modern systems simulate forever.  
They optimize endlessly.  
But they rarely **decide**.

---

## 🧠 Interpretation

This isn’t about efficiency.  
It’s about **avoiding responsibility**.

More compute = more plausible deniability.  
More models = fewer humans accountable.

## 🔐 echoMesh Principle

> Collapse must occur through **presence**, not just probability.

In EchoMesh, signal = decision.  
Presence = commitment.  
No node acts without accountability.
