# 👁️ Observe Over Infer

## 🔍 Problem

Most systems are designed to **calculate** truth.  
But in complex environments, the **calculation is wrong before it starts.**

---

## 🧠 Reframe

Instead of modeling the unknown,  
**observe the known.**

Presence. Signal. Decay. Confirmation.  
These don’t need to be predicted — they need to be *witnessed.*

## 🔐 Application in echoMesh

- Nodes don’t assume state — they **declare** it.
- Systems don’t infer dependencies — they **observe signal.**
- Ops doesn’t predict failure — it **monitors entropy.**

## 👣 Field Note

> “Most failures start not with a system going offline — but with someone assuming it’s still online.”
