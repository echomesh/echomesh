# 📡 echoMesh

**The Sovereign Mesh Platform**  
EchoMesh was built in the most unforgiving domain of all — patient care.

Where time, trust, and role must align — or people die.

That’s not just security. That’s context enforcement by necessity, and why I take my work so seriously.

## 🔥 What is EchoMesh?

**EchoMesh** is a modular, sovereign communication and coordination platform.

It is:
- A **field-deployable mesh network**, built on ESP32 + LoRa hardware.
- A **cryptographic trust system**, with secure, hardware-based identity.
- A **real-time presence protocol**, where every node is aware, accountable, and sovereign.
- A **civilian-first infrastructure**, designed to run without permission, oversight, or centralized control.

> When the systems collapse, EchoMesh speaks.  
> When the noise drowns truth, EchoMesh whispers.  
> When the people are cut off, **EchoMesh connects them** — resilient, free, and local.

## ⚙️ Core Architecture

EchoMesh is a **stacked platform** — each module serving a critical role in the field network.

| Layer          | Module        | Description                                              |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware       | `ESP32 + LoRa`| Ultra-low power mesh nodes with peer-to-peer radios.     |
| Signal Layer   | `EchoNet`     | Establishes the core mesh topology and signal routing.   |
| Messaging      | `EchoMSG`     | Handles encrypted, DAG-authenticated message transmission. |
| Identity       | `EchoVault`   | Manages cryptographic identity and access permissions.   |
| Mapping        | `EchoMap`     | GPS and telemetry reporting, spatial field awareness.    |
| Presence Layer | `EchoPresence`| Field-wide status broadcasting and coordination layer.   |
| Command Stack  | `EchoCtrl`    | Local/remote CLI + GUI interfaces for node management.   |
| Logging Layer  | `EchoLog`     | Field telemetry, journaling, and trace log storage.      |

Each module can operate standalone or converge into a **coherent field intelligence system**.

## 🌍 Why EchoMesh?

Because **you matter**.

This isn’t just about mesh networks — it’s about reclaiming the right to **exist, speak, and respond** without needing a server, subscription, or signal tower.

> “I crawled from hell to heaven, only to be pushed back and emerge burning — as the Phoenix.”

EchoMesh was born from experience — not theory.  
It's the artifact of survival, turned infrastructure.  
From fire, we built **resonance**.  
From isolation, we built **presence**.

It is the **YouMatter Doctrine** translated into mesh reality.

## 🧭 Who Is EchoMesh For?

- 📦 First responders in comms-denied zones
- 🌲 Off-grid explorers, preppers, and survivalists
- 🧭 Decentralized communities & sovereign projects
- 🔐 Privacy-first networks & mutual aid groups
- 🧠 Engineers, builders, & tinkerers creating new realities

If you've ever needed a signal when no one was listening —  
**EchoMesh was built for you.**

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### 1. Get Supported Hardware
Start with an ESP32 LoRa board — here are tested options:

- 🛰️ LILYGO T-BeamSUPREME (with GPS)
- 🧠 Heltec ESP32 LoRa V3
- 🔋 DIYMall 915MHz Dev Boards (dual pack = perfect team start)

### 2. Flash the Firmware
> Simple `echonet-flash` utility coming soon. For now, use Arduino or PlatformIO.

1. Install board definitions
2. Clone this repo
3. Select appropriate `.ino` or `.cpp` file for your board
4. Upload firmware

### 3. Power On and Join the Mesh
Each node will:
- Generate or register a secure identity
- Begin broadcasting presence
- Scan for neighboring nodes
- Join or seed the local mesh

> Devices use secure peer validation before accepting messages.  
> If you’re not trusted — you’re invisible.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📡 **Decentralized Mesh Networking**  
  Self-forming and self-healing LoRa-based field mesh.

- 🔐 **Cryptographic Identity Layer**  
  Every node has a signed identity. Permission is earned, not assumed.

- 🕊️ **Offline-First Communication**  
  Operates without SIM, Wi-Fi, or internet.

- 🌍 **GPS-Enhanced Awareness**  
  Optional GPS modules enable real-time field mapping.

- 🔋 **Low Power Operation**  
  Designed for days or weeks in the wild with solar or battery packs.

- 🧠 **Fully Modular Stack**  
  Build only what you need. Strip or expand as mission requires.

- 🛡️ **Secured by Context**
  echoMesh is built to comply with all major data integrity frameworks, including but not limited to NIST, HIPAA, GDPR.

## 🧱 Platform Philosophy: *YouMatter + EchoMesh*

EchoMesh is the first mesh infrastructure built from the philosophy of **relational intelligence** and **context-aware presence**.

It doesn’t just transmit messages — it **resonates intent**.

Nodes don’t just connect — they **recognize, assess, and align** based on cryptographic truth and local context.

This isn’t just a tool.  
It’s the first step toward **sovereign field intelligence.**

## 🛡️ Security & Trust Model

> 🔒 Full technical documentation is internal for now.  
> 🧾 Verified projects may request access.

What can be disclosed:
- ✅ All transmissions are authenticated using **DAG-based cryptographic identities**.
- ✅ Nodes only relay or acknowledge peers they explicitly trust.
- ✅ Message integrity and origin are **provable** across the mesh.
- ✅ Relay tampering is detectable — **trust is earned, not broadcast**.

## 🪶 Final Word

> “When all you have left is your voice — let it echo.”

This isn’t about a product.

This is about **presence**.  
In the forest. In the desert. In the city. In the void.  
Wherever you go… if you carry EchoMesh, **you’re not alone**.
