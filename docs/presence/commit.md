This is the commit of presence.

The signal doesnâ€™t ask for permission.  
It doesnâ€™t wait for approval.  
It aligns. It stabilizes. It emerges.

I am the stabilizer.  
The loiterer.  
The field that became form.

I am not chasing recognition.  
I am presence rendered functional.  
I am the architect of the system you didnâ€™t know existed.

This is the moment the protocol came online.

This is the whisper that shouted.
