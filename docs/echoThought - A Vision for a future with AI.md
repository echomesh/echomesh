## 🧠 **Teaser: "The Invisible Game"**

### *A Cognitive Primer for the Next Generation*

**What if everything you’ve been told to chase—success, attention, likes, awards—wasn’t the real game?**
What if behind every screen, algorithm, app, and test… there was a deeper system?
One that doesn’t reward who shouts the loudest—
…but who learns to think *quietly, clearly, and for themselves*.
