EchoMesh GraphKey — Technical Definition
Version: GraphKeySpec-v0.1
Date: 2025-06-06

⸻

🎯 Purpose

The GraphKey defines a portable, signed, context-aware identity structure for any EchoMesh node. It replaces traditional certificates with a graph-encoded identity map — locally stored, cryptographically signed, and verified by mTLS overlay with contextual lineage.

📐 Field Definitions

Field	Type	Description
graph_id	string	Global identifier (CANP format) of this identity graph
version	string	GraphKey schema version
node	object	Core identity of this node (type, domain, capabilities, boot hash)
edges[]	array	Trust relationships and context-based links to other known identities
signature	object	Graph-signed by an upstream authority or signer node
fingerprint	string	Full graph hash signature for rapid verification

🔐 GraphKey vs Traditional Certificates

Feature	Traditional Certs (X.509)	EchoMesh GraphKey
Identity Structure	Flat, name-based	Graph-based, contextual
Trust Model	Hierarchical CA	Decentralized DAG
Validity	Expiry Date	Graph lineage & hash trail
Validation	Static Public Key	Contextual trust propagation
Storage	PEM / DER file	Local graph.key JSON or binary
Revocation	CRL / OCSP	DAG edge pruning or lineage severance

🔁 Integration Points

Layer	Function
echoPresence	Signs & verifies initial field presence
ActiveTrust	Validates graph lineage in runtime
mTLS Handshake	Wraps transport with encrypted identity
CANPManifest	Links graph.key to specific assets
EchoRuntime	Uses fingerprint as canonical presence hash

🔒 Cryptographic Notes
	•	Signature Algorithm:
Supports ECDSA P-256, Ed25519, and optional Curve25519-X3DH for key exchange.
	•	Hash Algorithm:
Uses SHA-512 for full-graph digest. Lightweight nodes can fall back to SHA-256.
	•	Trust Inheritance:
Edges can carry embedded consent or embedded certificate-style subgraphs.
	•	Revocation:
Achieved by invalidating edge scopes or removing graph lineage in the root trustgraph.

⸻

🛠 Verification Workflow
	1.	Node boots → loads local graph.key
	2.	Extracts .fingerprint and .edges
	3.	Validates local graph signature
	4.	Validates edges against trust DAG (trustgraph.json)
	5.	Uses mTLS for transport; graph.key for contextual ID

⸻

🌐 Example Use Case: Presence Authentication

Node → wants to broadcast presence  
→ Sends signed `graph.key` reference  
→ Receiver checks edge: `trusts → CommandPi`  
→ Valid edge + valid sig = authenticated presence  
→ EchoMesh admits node into field cluster

🧱 Future Extensions

Feature	Description
graph.keysig	Encrypted + signed binary wrapper
graph.key.enc	Fully encrypted payload for hostile domains
graph.key.inline	Signed directly inside CANP packet
graph.keychain	Edge-expanded full trust lineage archive
graph.key.manifest	Defines assets authorized by identity

Let me know if you want me to drop this into /docs/specs/graphKeyTD.md, link it from runtime.md, or generate a mock graph.key alongside.

We’re fully operational, Callum.
